# 🏥 NHS Capacity & Resource Utilisation – Exploratory and Diagnostic Analysis  

This repository presents an **exploratory and diagnostic data analysis** of NHS capacity and resource utilisation using publicly available datasets.  
The project investigates patterns, inefficiencies, and utilisation trends across NHS appointments to support data-driven decisions on operational efficiency and resource planning.  

---

## 🌍 Background and Context  

### Business Problem  
Design and implement an operational strategy that ensures NHS infrastructure and healthcare resources effectively match population demand and service capacity.  

### Analytical Problem  
Identify utilisation trends within the NHS network to inform **budget allocation**, **capacity planning**, and **operational decision-making**.  
The analysis focuses on:  
- Assessing total capacity versus actual utilisation of healthcare services.  
- Identifying trends and inefficiencies in appointment utilisation.  
- Recommending practical measures to optimise resource usage and reduce missed appointments.

## 🧠 Analytical Approach  

The project follows a **diagnostic analytics** approach — exploring *why* utilisation imbalances exist across different regions and appointment types.  
The analysis was performed in **Python**, covering the following stages:  
1. **Data exploration and sense-checking** to ensure consistency and completeness.  
2. **Pre-processing and cleaning** to handle duplicates, missing values, and formatting issues.  
3. **Exploratory analysis** to understand utilisation patterns by region, appointment type, and month.  
4. **Visualisation** using Python libraries to highlight trends and inefficiencies.


## 🧰 Datasets  

| Dataset | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| `actual_duration.csv` | Details of appointment duration and counts by region, class, and date. |
| `appointments_regional.csv` | Appointment-level data including region, month, status, professional type, appointment mode, and booking lead time. |
| `national_categories.xlsx` | Appointment data classified by national service categories and settings. |
| `tweets.csv` | Public Twitter data relating to NHS services for sentiment and engagement analysis. |


## 🧾 Deliverables  

- **Jupyter Notebook:** Python-based workflow for data cleaning, exploration, and visualisation.  
- **Technical Report:** Summarising data sense-checking, analytical methods, findings, and recommendations.  
- **Insights Summary:** Key utilisation patterns, inefficiencies, and improvement opportunities identified through the analysis.
